pphrase
=======

This script generates a 4-random-word passphrase (Ã  la xkcd) using the 10,000
most common English words as determined by n-gram frequency analysis of
Google's Trillion Word Corpus (courtesy_ of `Josh Kaufman`_).

This was a morning-coffee project; just getting used to git submodules and the
github interface
